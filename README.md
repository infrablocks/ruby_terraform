# RubyTerraform

A simple wrapper around the Terraform binary to allow execution from within
a Ruby program or Rakefile.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-terraform'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-terraform


## Usage

RubyTerraform needs to know where the terraform binary is located before it
can do anything. By default, RubyTerraform looks on the path however this can
be configured with:

```ruby
RubyTerraform.configure do |config|
  config.binary = 'vendor/terraform/bin/terraform'
end
```

In addition, each command that requires the terraform binary (all except 
`clean`) takes a `binary` keyword argument at initialisation that overrides the
global configuration value.

Currently, there is partial support for the following commands:
* `RubyTerraform::Commands::Clean`: clean up all locally held terraform state
  and modules.
* `RubyTerraform::Commands::Init`: executes `terraform init`
* `RubyTerraform::Commands::Get`: executes `terraform get`
* `RubyTerraform::Commands::Plan`: executes `terraform plan`
* `RubyTerraform::Commands::Apply`: executes `terraform apply`
* `RubyTerraform::Commands::Destroy`: executes `terraform destroy`
* `RubyTerraform::Commands::Output`: executes `terraform output`
* `RubyTerraform::Commands::RemoteConfig`: executes `terraform remote config`

### RubyTerraform::Commands::Clean

The clean command can be called in the following ways:

```ruby
RubyTerraform.clean
RubyTerraform.clean(directory: 'infra/.terraform')
RubyTerraform::Commands::Clean.new(directory: 'infra/.terraform').execute
RubyTerraform::Commands::Clean.new.execute(directory: 'infra/.terraform')
```

When called, it removes the contents of the .terraform directory in the
working directory by default. If another directory is specified, it instead
removes the specified directory.


### RubyTerraform::Commands::Init

The init command will initialise a terraform environment. It can be called in 
the following ways:

```ruby
RubyTerraform.init
RubyTerraform.init(from-module: 'some/module/path', path: 'infra/module')
RubyTerraform::Commands::Init.new.execute
RubyTerraform::Commands::Init.new.execute(
    from-module: 'some/module/path', 
    path: 'infra/module')
```

The init command supports the following options passed as keyword arguments:
* `from-module`: the source module to use to initialise; required if `path` is specified
* `path`: the path to initialise.
* `backend`: `true`/`false`, whether or not to configure the backend.
* `get`: `true`/`false`, whether or not to get dependency modules.
* `backend_config`: a map of backend specific configuration parameters.
* `no_color`: whether or not the output from the command should be in color;
  defaults to `false`.
* `plugin_dir`: directory containing plugin binaries. Overrides all default;
  search paths for plugins and prevents the automatic installation of plugins.


### RubyTerraform::Commands::Get

The get command will fetch any modules referenced in the provided terraform
configuration directory. It can be called in the following ways:

```ruby
RubyTerraform.get(directory: 'infra/networking')
RubyTerraform::Commands::Get.new.execute(directory: 'infra/networking')
```

The get command supports the following options passed as keyword arguments:
* `directory`: the directory containing terraform configuration; required.
* `update`: whether or not already downloaded modules should be updated; 
  defaults to `false`.
* `no_color`: whether or not the output from the command should be in color;
  defaults to `false`.
  
  
### RubyTerraform::Commands::Plan

The plan command will generate the execution plan in the provided
configuration directory. It can be called in the following ways:

```ruby
RubyTerraform.plan(
  directory: 'infra/networking', 
  vars: {
    region: 'eu-central'
  })
RubyTerraform::Commands::Plan.new.execute(
  directory: 'infra/networking',
  vars: {
    region: 'eu-central'
  })
```

The plan command supports the following options passed as keyword arguments:
* `directory`: the directory containing terraform configuration; required.
* `vars`: a map of vars to be passed in to the terraform configuration.
* `var_file`: the path to a terraform var file; if both `var_file` and 
  `var_files` are provided, all var files will be passed to terraform.
* `var_files`: an array of paths to terraform var files; if both `var_file` and 
  `var_files` are provided, all var files will be passed to terraform.
* `state`: the path to the state file in which to store state; defaults to
  terraform.tfstate in the working directory or the remote state if configured.
* `plan`: the name of the file in which to save the generated plan.
* `input`: when `false`, will not ask for input for variables not directly set; defaults to `true`.
* `destroy`: when `true`, a plan will be generated to destroy all resources
  managed by the given configuration and state; defaults to `false`.
* `no_color`: whether or not the output from the command should be in color;
  defaults to `false`.
  
  
### RubyTerraform::Commands::Apply

The apply command applies terraform configuration in the provided terraform
configuration directory. It can be called in the following ways:

```ruby
RubyTerraform.apply(
  directory: 'infra/networking', 
  vars: {
    region: 'eu-central'
  })
RubyTerraform::Commands::Apply.new.execute(
  directory: 'infra/networking',
  vars: {
    region: 'eu-central'
  })
```

The apply command supports the following options passed as keyword arguments:
* `directory`: the directory containing terraform configuration; required.
* `vars`: a map of vars to be passed in to the terraform configuration.
* `var_file`: the path to a terraform var file; if both `var_file` and 
  `var_files` are provided, all var files will be passed to terraform.
* `var_files`: an array of paths to terraform var files; if both `var_file` and 
  `var_files` are provided, all var files will be passed to terraform. 
* `state`: the path to the state file in which to store state; defaults to
  terraform.tfstate in the working directory or the remote state if configured.
